	<h1 id="header2">Plaza</h1>

	<div class="Container">

	<p id="Paragraph1">Plaza is the work of British designer Alan Meeks, an Art Deco sans serif style. It includes many alternative characters which offer endless possibilities. Plaza is ideal for work in which a feel of the 1920s or 30s is desired.</p>

	<p id="Paragraph2">Prolific type designer, b. London, 1951. Alan started working in 1970 for Graphic Systems as a lettering artist. In 1975, he joined Letraset as the Senior Type Designer and Studio Manager where he was responsible for all the artwork produced by the Letraset studio. During his tenure at Letraset, he designed over 40 popular typefaces, including Bramley, Candice, Bickley Script and Belwe. Most of these typefaces also showed up in the Scangraphic collection. Together with type director Colin Brignall, Alan contributed to the success of Letraset. </p>

	<p id="Paragraph3">All the original typographic artwork produced at Letraset was produced by hand cutting the fonts in Rubylith, a highly-skilled technique known as stencil cutting. Alan was responsible for training the entire Letraset studio in this art. Most of the original Letraset artwork has now been archived at St. Brides Printing Library, London. Today, Alan works independently, specializing in all facets of corporate identity including type design, typography, packaging, and development of logos and symbols.</p>

	<p id="Paragraph4">Meeks' Plaza font is heavily influenced by Art Deco, a design phhilosphy and aesthetic that emerged in France and rose in popularity within the 1920s-1940s. Art deco goes by a variety of names, including Streamline, Modernistic, Jazz Modern, etc. Art Deco is one of the most influential styles in America, not just in typeface, but in archiecture, fashion, and more. More or less defining the 1920s-40s, Art Deco created a feeling of wealth, power and luxury in an otherwise struggling period of economic depression for America.</p>

	<h1 id="header3">Art Deco</h1>

	<div class="Container2">

	<p id="Paragraph5">Looking into it origins, art deco was born when Beaux-Arts began runnin out of style. This was particularly noticable in mid 1910's New York, where the Beaux-Arts era had ushered in too any high rise skyscraper buildings. The Beaux-Arts style was taught at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was the predominant established style of architecture in Europe and America from the 1830s to the early 20th century, ranging from neoclassical design philosophy mixed with steel, glass and iron, pretty much dominating the art design from about 1870 to 1920.</p>

	<p id="Paragraph6">World War 1 was a major catalyst for the birth and rise of Art Deco. The aftermath of the war left many nations in shambles economically and in personal identity, more specifically Europe. People were em\\[bracing the future instead of burying themselves in nostalgia of the past. Art Deco would make its blow up during the Paris Exposition of 1925. The exhibition only permitted new styles and exluded anything that carried a classical aesthetic. Art Deco was a sign that people were ready to move into the future and focus on modernity instead of holding onto the classical aspects of the previous design philosophies. Art Deco heavily deviated from the cleaner and more reserved designs of the Bauhaus and De Stijl eras. Art Deco had a lavish and bold looking aesthetic filled with gemoetrical features and bright flashy colors.</p> 
	
	<p id="Paragraph7">The term ‘Art Deco’ came into use in the 1960s from a book by Bevis Hillier titled Art Deco which was an adaptation of “artes decoratifes” from the full name of the 1925 Paris exposition. During the period, buildings of this style were simply called modern or modernistic. Art Deco as an architectural style is an umbrella term and encompasses several different variations, but all with a theme of modernity, rejecting the immediate past and reimagining ancient and exotic motifs. Some of these characteristics may be seen to be mixed and matched, so it can often be difficult to clearly categorize a building by style. Some types of decoration you will find on any Art Deco building regardless of style or location. </p>

		<p id="Paragraph8">iThese are typically stylized geometric forms such as zigzags, chevrons, squares within squares, diamonds etc. It is also common to find stylized organic forms mixed with the geometrics: fern tendrils, flowers of all kinds, and fountains were common. There were also unique regional elements that would vary by region and country. In Los Angeles you see palm fronds, grape clusters, sunbursts, and ocean waves, all representing the Southern California arcadia. Art Deco rejected the immediate past but often looked to the distant past for inspiration. Ancient cultures, such as the Egyptian, Mayan, and Assyrian, were stylized and re-imagined. But most of all Art Deco looked to the future, embraced technology and celebrated it. </p>

<h1 id="header4">Batman: The Animated Series</h1>

<p id="Paragraph9">A better representation of the Plaza font can be seen in classic cartoons like Batman: the Animated Series. The font meshes very well with Batman: TAS's art deco/noir based aesthetic, which very much mimics the architecture and vehicle designs of the 1920s-30s. The combinaion of Alan Meeks's Plaza typeface and the art deco inspired designs of the animated Batman show helped create a unique identity for not just the show itself but the entire world of Batman. Gotham had effectively become a character with its own individual personality and visual identity, and the font very much complements the look.</p>
